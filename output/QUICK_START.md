## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Tag Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
```
#writing, #ai, #tips, #design
(lowercase, specific, consistent)
```

❌ **DON'T:**
```
#Writing, #WritingTips, #my-writing
(inconsistent, too specific, special chars)
```

### Color Coding Strategy

**Suggested use:**
```
🔴 Red      → Urgent, important
🟡 Yellow   → To remember, highlights
🔵 Blue     → Technical, code
🟣 Purple   → Creative, brainstorming
🟢 Green    → Completed, verified
🩷 Pink     → Personal, experimental
```

### Smart Combinations

**Three ways to find prompts:**

1. **By color:** Quick visual scan
   - Look at cards, spot blue ones
   - Visual at-a-glance organization

2. **By tag:** Click sidebar
   - Click #writing to see all writing prompts
   - Most intuitive discovery

3. **By search:** Type in search bar
   - Search "ChatGPT" for specific content
   - Most precise results

**Combine them:**
- Filter by #ai tag
- Then search "gpt"
- Result: Only AI prompts about GPT
